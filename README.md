Hello, other person!
I'm Justin.
I think lots of things are cool, but I have trouble focusing on them- particularly when I do not have a task with a deadline.
Instead I cram my head full of useless junk (not unlike most other Americans.)
I prefer healthy things to unhealthy ones, but I find myself doing the unhealthy things anyway.
Still, I am pretty smart, so I will probably be able to get a graduate degree and become useful.
My favorite color is blue... or red.
My favorite canned good is smoked chipotle peppers in adobo.
My girlfriend is beautiful and her name is Isabela.
I like dogs.
